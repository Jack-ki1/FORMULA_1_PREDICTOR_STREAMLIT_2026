Probability Model — v2 accuracy improvements.

FIXES vs v1:
  1. Safety car boost was applied to top drivers (wrong) — now correctly boosts mid-field (P6-P15)
  2. Gaussian noise is now scaled by circuit SC probability (chaotic circuits get more variance)
  3. DNF probability is now adjusted for race distance (more laps = higher compound DNF chance)
  4. Softmax temperature tuned: 0.28 gives better discrimination without over-concentrating
  5. Position tracking is now bounded correctly (no driver assigned beyond FIELD_SIZE)
  
BUG FIX (v2.1):
  6. Platt calibration now uses separate parameters per outcome type (win/top3/top10/dnf)
     Previously used identical A/B parameters for all outcomes, destroying discrimination power.

FEATURE-16 ADDITION:
  7. Confidence intervals computed via bootstrap resampling for uncertainty quantification.

    # BUG-01 / NEW-01 FIX: Apply Platt calibration with separate parameters per outcome type.
    # NOTE: We do NOT renormalize after Platt calibration because:
    # 1. Win probabilities should sum to ~100% naturally if model is well-calibrated.
    # 2. Renormalizing wins but not top3/top10 creates mathematical inconsistency (NEW-01).
    # 3. If sums deviate significantly from expected, it indicates calibration needs refitting.
